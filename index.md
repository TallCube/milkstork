# Marketing Optimization Update

### This Week's Topic: Conversion and Transaction Analysis

## Testing Status

  As of this morning, split (A/B) testing has gone live. The first experiment measures the impact additional product copy and the PYT ordering sequence has on your website’s sales performance. Our goal is to dramatically increase the conversion rate (and revenue) from first-impression visitors.

## Targeting “High Potential” Visitors

  It's normal (and only logical) for any e-Commerce business to find repeat visitors out-performing new visitors. By continuation of that concept, we also expect that first-time visitors will always appear to be less valuable than repeat visitors.
